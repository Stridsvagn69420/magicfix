# magicfix
Command-line tool to repair your file extensions

File signatures are from both [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) as well as the [infer](https://github.com/bojand/infer) crate.  
The tool only depends on the C Standard Libraries so it practically compiles anywhere, even on your phone! (I'm not joking)

## Installation
This section is only about self-compilation. Check the [Release Page](https://github.com/Stridsvagn69420/magicfix/releases) for prebuilt binaries.

### Windows (MSVC)
WIP.

### Windows (MinGW) and Unix
